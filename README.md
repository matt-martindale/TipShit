# Tip$#!%

## The sarcastic, sharp-tongued tip calculator

This iOS app allows you to do all normal things a tipping calculator does:

* Calculates any percentage of tip
* Automatically splits up the bill depending on the number in party
* Easily round up/down total bill to whole dollars and recalculates totals
* Review bill with convenient receipt created afterwards
* Beautiful dark-mode design that's easy on the eyes

**Except this one comes with one handy-dandy feature...**

## It critiques and judges your tip.
